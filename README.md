## About
This project is **fan** recreation of **Resident Evil 2 (Remake)** inventory system in **Unity Engine**. </br>

Art assets are from the original game, but they only exists to make things more visual. </br>
For more information about using these assets in personal **(non revenue)** projects, please refer to **[FAQ](http://www.capcom-europe.com/faq/)** page of Capcom.

The system is fully integrated for **controllers**. Which means you can navigate between items and perform specific actions </br>
with controller. </br>

However, there are still missing features such as **slot merging** and **examining items**. But it should be relatively easy to add new or missing features.
